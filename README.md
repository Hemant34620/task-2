1 What Is This About?
This is a short report where I studied a fake email that pretended to be from PayPal. These kinds of emails are called **phishing emails** — they try to trick you into clicking a bad link and giving away your personal information (like your password or credit card)



3 What Did the Email Say?

- **Subject:** "[PayPal]: Your account access has been limited"
- **From:** services@paypal-accounts.com
- **Message:** It said my PayPal account had a problem and would be disabled in 24 hours unless I clicked a button to fix it

4 Step-by-Step What I Found

### 1. **Fake Email Address**
The email came from **paypal-accounts.com**, which is **not the real PayPal website**. Real PayPal emails come from addresses like `service@paypal.com`.

5 **Tricky Link**
There was a blue button that said **"Confirm Your Information."** If I clicked it, it would probably go to a **fake PayPal login page**. That’s how scammers try to steal passwords.

6 **Scary Language**
The email tried to make me panic. It said:
> “You have 24 hours to solve the problem or your account will be permanently disabled.”

This kind of message makes people act fast — which is exactly what scammers want.
7 **Grammar and Spelling Mistakes**
The email had some small mistakes, like:
- “permanetly” instead of “permanently”
- Weird punctuation and grammar

Big companies like PayPal don’t usually make these kinds of errors.

8 **No Name**
The email started with **“Dear PayPal customer”** instead of my real name. That’s a sign it’s not from a real company — just a fake message sent to lots of people.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This email is **definitely a scam**. It uses:
- A fake sender address
- Scary language to pressure me
- A fake button
- Grammar mistakes
- No personal greeting

If you ever get an email like this, **don’t click anything**. Instead:
- **Report it** (for PayPal, send it to `spoof@paypal.com`)
- **Delete it right away**
